As an freshman MIS student interested in backend engineering, I'm currently using technologies like PostgreSQL, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, gRPC ,Protocol Buffers and Postman.

Nowadays I'm eager to learn more about microservices architecture and the Golang to design more efficient and resilient backend systems. Additionally, I enjoy solving algorithm questions, which helps me improve my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

I'm still a Student Expert in the Postman Student Community, where I continue to learn and help others with their API-related questions and challenges.

You can find all of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbsemih).
